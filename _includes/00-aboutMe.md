# About
> I am in my last term of my Computer Science degree at UNLV and will be graduating come May 2021. Over the past three years, I have gained experience with the following programming languages: C++, C, x86, MIPS, Java, and Python; with C++ being what I am most comfortable with at the moment. I am working on improving my Python and Java skills, as well as preparing in my free time to take the CompTIA Security+ and A+ exams. I take all computer science book recommendations and add them to my terribly long to be read list. I am a lifelong learner and I enjoy that I can learn something new every day with computer programming.
